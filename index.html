    <p>A bright, healthy smile starts with good daily habits and a little expert care. Here are practical and effective tips to help you maintain strong, sparkling teeth:</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Brush with Proper Technique</h2>
      <p>Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and gentle circular motions. Hold the brush at a 45° angle to the gumline to sweep away plaque. Avoid vigorous scrubbing, which can wear away enamel and irritate your gums.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Don’t Skip Daily Flossing</h2>
      <p>Flossing removes food particles and plaque buildup between teeth—places your toothbrush can’t reach. Make it a daily habit to protect against gum disease and cavities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Use Fluoride Toothpaste</h2>
      <p>Fluoride strengthens enamel, making your teeth more resistant to decay. Choose a toothpaste that contains fluoride and look for the ADA Seal of Acceptance if available.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Limit Sugary & Acidic Foods</h2>
      <p>Try to minimize snacks and drinks with high sugar or acidity, such as soda, candy, and citrus fruits. If you do enjoy them, rinse your mouth with water afterward and wait at least 30 minutes before brushing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Stay Hydrated & Rinse Often</h2>
      <p>Water encourages saliva production, which naturally washes away bacteria. It’s also great to rinse your mouth after meals to neutralize acids and clear leftover food particles.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Visit Your Dentist Regularly</h2>
      <p>Try to schedule cleanings and check-ups every six months. Professional cleanings remove tartar and catch potential issues early—keeping your smile healthy and beautiful.</p>
